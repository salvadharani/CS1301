#Remember that Fibonacci's sequence is a sequence of numbers
#where every number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
#
#For this problem, implement Fibonacci recursively, with a
#twist! Imagine that we want to create a new number sequence
#called Fibonacci-3. In Fibonacci-3, each number in the
#sequence is the sum of the previous three numbers. The
#sequence will start with three 1s, so the fourth Fibonacci-3
#number would be 3 (1+1+1), the fifth would be 5 (1+1+3),
#the sixth would be 9 (1+3+5), the seventh would be 17
#(3+5+9), etc.
#
#Name your function fib3, and make sure to use recursion.


#Write your code here!

def fib3(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2 or n == 3:
        return 1
    else:
        return fib3(n-1) + fib3(n-2) + fib3(n-3)

#The lines below will test your code. If your funciton is
#correct, they will print 1, 3, 17, and 57.
print(fib3(3))
print(fib3(4))
print(fib3(7))
print(fib3(9))
