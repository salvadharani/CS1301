#Classes can also have references to other instances of
#themselves. Consider this Person class, for example,
#that allows for an instance of a father and mother
#to be given in the constructor.
#
#Create 3 instances of this class. The first should have
#the name "Mr. Burdell" with an age of 53. The second
#instance should have a name of "Mrs. Burdell" with an age
#of 53 as well. Finally, make an instance with the name of
#"George P. Burdell" with an age of 25. This final instance
#should also have the father attribute set to the instance
#of Mr. Burdell, and the mother attribute set to the
#instance of Mrs. Burdell. Finally, store the instance of
#George P. Burdell in a variable called george_p. (It does
#not matter what variable names you use for Mr. and Mrs.
#Burdell.)
