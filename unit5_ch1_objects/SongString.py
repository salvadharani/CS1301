# Below are the two class definitions we supplied previously:
# Artist and Song.
#
# Write a function called "get_song_string". It should accept
# one argument which will be a Song object. It should return
# a string in the following format:
#
# "<song name>" - <artist name> (<song year>)
# e.g:
# "You Belong With Me" - Taylor Swift (2008)
#
# The quotation marks around the song title should be *part*
# of the string.
#
# Hint: You're writing a function, not a method. That means
# the function get_song_string should not be inside either
# of these classes.

class Artist:
    def __init__(self, name, label):
        self.name = name
        self.label = label


class Song:
    def __init__(self, name, album, year, artist):
        self.name = name
        self.album = album
        self.year = year
        self.artist = artist

def get_song_string(song):
    return '"{}" - {} ({})'.format(song.name, song.artist.name, song.year)

# The code below will test your function. It isn't used for
# grading, so feel free to modify it.
newArtist = Artist("Taylor Swift", "Big Machine Records, LLC")
newSong = Song("You Belong With Me", "Fearless", 2008, newArtist)
